# Git & Github

## What is VCS?

Generations:
* 0gen - No VC
* 1gen - File locks
* 2gen - CVCS (Centralized)
* 3gen - DVCS (Distributed)

Purposes?
* allows multiple people to work on a single project in the same time
* integrates work done simultaneously by different team members
* gives access to historical versions of your project

example: Wikipedia history of changes

example: history panel in Photoshop

## Life without VCS

Generation 0
* Without version control - backup.zip 
* One developer - ok.
* Two developers - danger!
* Five developers - madness!

Generation 1 - File Locks

Generation 2 - Central VCS
* SVN

problems? weaknesses?

Generation 3 - DVCS

## Centralized vs Decentralized

Distributed and centralized version control:
* centralized  (example: Subversion)
* distributed (DVSC)  â€“ more modern, runs faster, is less prone to errors, has more features, more complex to understand (example: Mercurial, Git)

Central VCS

There is just one repository:
* You commit
* They update

* You push (to remote)
* They pull (from remote)
* They update (to their local)
